# sort-visualizer
Scripts to visualize and profile common sorting algorithms.

I've wanted to make [this](https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms) sort of animation since the first time I saw it in CS50 about 4 years ago,
because they look so cool.

Includes the following sorting algorithms:
* Bubble sort
* Selection sort
* Insertion sort
* Merge sort
* Quick sort
* Heap sort
* Radix sort

# Examples
## Snapshots
Snapshots of animations of insertion, merge and heap sorts.

### Insertion sort

Note the sorted portion forming on the left.

### Merge sort

Note the sorted subarrays before merging.

### Heap sort
<img src="https://github.com/nikhilkmr300/sort-visualizer/blob/master/snapshots/heap.png" width="320">
Note the sorted portion forming on the right,
as the root of the max-heap is extracted and pushed to the back of the array.
